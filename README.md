## Background
This project is my first full stack project, in an attempt to get access to some student community in which I believe I will be able to enhance myself. After finnishing this project, I did enlarged my technology stack and had a more comprehensive understanding of HTTP protocol, database and JavaScript. 

## Prerequisites
This project involves techniques including but not limited:
- HTTP Protocal
- Egg.js Framework
- Vue.js Framework (including: Vue, Vuex, Vue-router, Vue-cli)
- Nginx
- Forward and backward proxy
- JavaScript
- MySQL and database related language
- Shell
I strongly suggest you at least have a basic understanding on these techniques above.
Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:
- You have a server machine or have access to ECS(Elastic Compute Service).
- You have installed Vue.js on client/server machine, egg.js, MySQL and Nginx on server machine.

## Installation
The project is splited into three parts: back-end files, front-end files and data in the databases.

### Start with Front-end files
Due to the dearth of max uploading files, I only kept the files in '/src/'. To reuse them, you shall put them into a vue project accordingly and build them. Afterwards, you shall put the outcomes in the dir where Nginx can correctly trace them as is descripted in the conf file.

### Finish Back-end Part
